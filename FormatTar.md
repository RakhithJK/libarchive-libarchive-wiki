# About the Tar format

First Edition UNIX included a tape backup program called "tap".
When Fourth Edition UNIX extended the file system interface, it was replaced by the "tp" program.
Similarly, when Seventh Edition UNIX was released in January 1979, it featured a new set of file system features and a new tape backup program called "tar."

Until 1985, the "tar format" was just the format supported by the "tar" program.
Of course, there were several other implementations by this point.
To ensure compatibility, the first POSIX standard included a specification for "UNIX Standard TAR" format (ustar) that extended the original tar format slightly.
